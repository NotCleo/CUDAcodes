# CUDAcodes

This Repo contains all the CUDA codes I have written

1) Monte Carlo Simulation for Option Pricing
2) Parallel Reduction
3) Image Convolution
4) Parallel Scan
5) Parallel Compact
6) Matrix Transpose 
7) Parallel Reductions

Note : Have covered loop unrolling, shared memory, warp divergence and plenty more techniques to above algorithms

BONUS : I have also added the performance comparisons of the reduction kernels. 

I have used the Nvidia H100 GPU, 

-> Hopper Arch
-> 14,592 cores
