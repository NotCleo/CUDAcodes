# CUDAcodes

This Repo contains all the CUDA kernels I have written

1) Monte Carlo Simulation for Option Pricing
2) Parallel Reduction
3) Image Convolution
4) Parallel Scan
5) Parallel Compact
6) Matrix Transpose 
7) Parallel Reductions

Note : Have covered loop unrolling, shared memory, warp divergence and plenty more techniques to above algorithms

BONUS : I have also added the performance comparisons of the reduction kernels. 

I have used the Nvidia H100 GPU

The repository also holds the following CUDA kernels 

1) Radix sorting
2) Merge sorting
3) Matrix transpose
4) Convolution (1D/2D) with constant memory masking and with global memory access
5) Thread/Block organization
6) FP performance comparison
